Game Summar: Mental Madness/Maze is a 3D puzzle platformer where the player can rotate the camera to navigate the world from a 2D lens to discover new features. The game is set inside a human brain where the user plays as a neuron navigating puzzles related to the functions of different sections of the brain. Chapters of the game are set and connected into each lobe of the brain, where game mechanics are impacted by the actual functions of that brain section. The players' goal is to discover all sections of the brain.
